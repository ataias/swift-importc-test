* swift-importc-test

This demo package imports cmark in a swift package and then makes a call. It is
based on a [[https://oleb.net/blog/2017/12/importing-c-library-into-swift/][tutorial on Ole Begemman's website]].

** Running

You can run debug or release mode with the [[./Makefile][Makefile]], check it out. An example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make debug && make run-debug
#+END_SRC

** Caveats
Your library should be installed so that "pkg-config" can find it.

** Motivation
- I had issues with the aforementioned tutorial. The compiler was complaining
  about system modules being deprecated and that I should use a system library
  instead. I couldn't find a solution in my time allocated for it
- I looked instead on [[https://github.com/broadwaylamb/OpenCombine][OpenCombine]], which has some C code in its repo and
  eventually came up with this one
- pkg-config is called on the Makefile, as I couldn't figure out how to add it
  on [[./Package.swift][Package.swift]] directly
